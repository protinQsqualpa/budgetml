One of his most famous writings is "Why I am an Atheist", which he wrote in 1930 while he was in jail. In this essay, he explains his reasons for rejecting the belief in God and religion. He argues that he does not need any consolation or reward from a supernatural power for his actions. He says that he is responsible for his own deeds and consequences. He also criticizes the hypocrisy and superstition of religious people and leaders. He asserts that he believes in humanism and rationalism.
