Tecnometal 4d Pro has many features that make it a versatile and efficient tool for steel structure design. Some of these features are:
 
- It supports various types of steel elements, such as beams, columns, trusses, braces, plates, bolts, welds, and connections.
- It allows users to create parametric models that can be easily modified and updated.
- It provides automatic calculations of loads, stresses, displacements, and reactions.
- It generates detailed reports and drawings that comply with international standards and codes.
- It integrates with other BIM software through IFC and DWG formats.
- It offers a user-friendly interface that can be customized according to user preferences.

Tecnometal 4d Pro is available for download from the official website of Steel & Graphics. The software requires a license key to activate. Users can request a free trial version or purchase a full version online. The software also comes with a comprehensive manual and video tutorials that explain how to use the software effectively.
 
Tecnometal 4d Pro is a software product that can help users design and inspect steel structures in a fast and accurate way. It is suitable for engineers, designers, architects, and students who work with steel structures. Tecnometal 4d Pro is a software product that can enhance the productivity and quality of steel structure design.
  
Tecnometal 4d Pro is based on the BIM (Building Information Modeling) concept, which means that it creates a digital representation of the physical and functional characteristics of a building. BIM allows users to share information and collaborate across different disciplines and stages of the project. BIM also enables users to perform simulations and analyses that can improve the performance and sustainability of the building.
 
Tecnometal 4d Pro is compatible with ArchiCAD and Grasshopper, two popular BIM software that allow users to create parametric and generative models. ArchiCAD is a software that provides a complete solution for architectural design and documentation. Grasshopper is a plugin for Rhino that allows users to create complex shapes and structures using algorithms and logic. Tecnometal 4d Pro can import and export models from ArchiCAD and Grasshopper, as well as modify them according to the user's needs.
 
Tecnometal 4d Pro also supports other CAD and BIM software such as AutoCAD, Revit, and SAP2000. AutoCAD is a software that is widely used for 2D and 3D design and drafting. Revit is a software that is specialized for building design and construction. SAP2000 is a software that is focused on structural analysis and design. Tecnometal 4d Pro can exchange data with these software through IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) and DWG (Drawing) formats, which are standard formats for interoperability in the construction industry.
